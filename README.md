# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We analyzed data from Kickstarter dataset to help Louise set fundraising goals for her play Fever. We analyzed how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates as well as funding goals 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We looked at all the theater category fundraisers and compared the outcomes based on the fundraiser launch month. The below visualization shows how many fundraisers were successful, how many failed and how many were cancelled based on the campaign launch month since 2009

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We looked at all the plays to evaluate what fundraising budget goals generated most successful campaigns. The visualization below depicts percentage successful, failed and cancelled plays based on the goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the main challenges encountered with this data set was UNIX Timestamp used to signify the deadline and the launch date. We were able to overcome this challenge by converting the UNIX Timestamp to a usable date format by applying a formula that converted seconds since January 1, 1970 to an actual date. This allowed us to understand the timeframes for each fundraiser. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
