# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We analyzed data from Kickstarter dataset to help Louise set fundraising goals for her play Fever. We analyzed how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates as well as funding goals 

## Analysis and Challenges
